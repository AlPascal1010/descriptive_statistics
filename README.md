Mean (μ) = ΣX / N Where ΣX is the sum of all the values in the dataset and N is the number of values.

Median = (n + 1) / 2 Where n is the number of values in the dataset.

Mode = the most frequently occurring value in a dataset.

Range = Max value - Min value

Variance (σ^2) = Σ(X - μ)^2 / N Where Σ(X - μ)^2 is the sum of the squared differences between each value and the mean, and N is the number of values.

Standard deviation (σ) = √σ^2 Where σ^2 is the variance.

quartile, this is a bit tricky
To solve for quartiles:

Arrange the data in ascending order from smallest to largest.

Determine the position of the median (Q2). If the number of data points is odd, the median is the middle value. If the number of data points is even, the median is the average of the two middle values.

Calculate the first quartile (Q1) by finding the median of the lower half of the data. If the number of data points is odd, Q1 is the median of the data points to the left of the overall median. If the number of data points is even, Q1 is the median of the data points to the left of the overall median.

Calculate the third quartile (Q3) by finding the median of the upper half of the data. If the number of data points is odd, Q3 is the median of the data points to the right of the overall median. If the number of data points is even, Q3 is the median of the data points to the right of the overall median.

Once you have determined Q1, Q2, and Q3, you can use them to calculate the interquartile range (IQR) by subtracting Q1 from Q3.
